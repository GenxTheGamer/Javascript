## Variable Declaration
Earlier before 2015, the only keyword available to declare variables was the `var` keyword. With JavaScript ES6 introduced, the two new keywords that came into existence are `const` and `let`.

-   `var`: Function in which the variable is declared
-   `let`: Block in which the variable is declared
-   `const`: Block in which the variable is declared



## Ways to Declare JavaScript Function

There are many ways to declare a function in JavaScript. The two most common ways are by using function declaration or by function operator. In the function declaration, the `function` keywords appear before the function name. Whereas if the `function` keyword appears anywhere else, that means we are declaring the function by the function operator method. Given below are the six different methods which are used in JavaScript to declare a function.

-    Function Declaration `function function_name(Arg1, Arg2..){}`

-    Function Expression
    Named: `var var_name = function function_name(Arg1,Arg2..){};`
    Anonymous:`var var_name = function(Arg1, Arg2..){};` 

-    Generator Function   `function* name(Arg1, Arg2..) {}`

-    Generator Function Expression
    Named: `function* function_name(Arg1,Arg2..){}`
    Anonymous:`function* (Arg1,Arg2..){}`
    
-    Arrow Function
    `var var_name = (Arg1, Arg2..) => {};`

-    Function Constructor
     `var var_name = new Function(Arg1, Arg2..,'FunctionBodyString');`
