## Variable Declaration
Earlier before 2015, the only keyword available to declare variables was the `var` keyword. With JavaScript ES6 introduced, the two new keywords that came into existence are `const` and `let`.

-   `var`: Function in which the variable is declared
-   `let`: Block in which the variable is declared
-   `const`: Block in which the variable is declared
